when we write TS, we are just writing JS
Typescript = JavaScript + a type system 

the type system is what this is all about 

The TS Type system:
  helps us catch errors during development
  Uses 'type annotations' to analyze our code
  only active during development
  doesn't provide any performance optimization

TS code => JS with type annotations => TS compiler => Vanille JS => render
  never executing TS, only JS
  TS is just JS with type annotation used to help us catch errors

typescriptlang.org/play
  TS to JS converter
  
TS is a friend looking over your shoulder to help you catch errors during development

npm install -g typescript ts-node

tsc --help 

tsc: ts compiler
